# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in key data science skills, including data wrangling, visualization, and  application of statistical models. My focus was on integrating data from diverse sources, exploring relationships within the data, and finally building a regression model to understand the factors influencing the number of bikes in a given location.

## Process
- Structuring Dataframes: I Defined the initial structure for the dataframes to ensure a seamless integration of information from Yelp API, Foursquare API, and City Bike API. The structure was designed with the end goals in mind, which allowed easier data manipulation and analysis


- Data Parsing: I parsed through the extensive data obtained from each API, adhering to the predefined dataframe structures. The process required me to have a better and deeper understanding of JSON structures, and how to efficiently extract relevant information from nested data.


- Combining Dataframes: I successfully joined data from the three dataframes. I ensured validation of the combined data, by running test and confirming the results


- Identifying Relationships: I defined specific questions to explore the relationships within the data and utilized visualizations, such as box plots, to compare the number of bikes with other various factors, including the total number of surrounding venues and went on deeper to comparing the number of bikes and the category of the surrounding stores to see if there was any relationship between them. 

- Building a Regression Model:I appplied statistical modeling techniques to investigate and confirm/dispute initial hypotheses.
I used the model to explore the impact of independent variables, particularly focusing on the relationship between the number of bikes and characteristics of the surrounding venues.


## Results
The API results were extensive and contained a lot of details. Yelp API however was better has it provided more details and in a cleaner structure as well. Yelp API also provided better documentation that enabled me to quickly look through what I needed and implement them

## Challenges 
- Parsing JSON data posed a significant challenge, and required a deep dive into understanding nested structures.


## Future Goals
- Independent Variables: I will go on to complete a more in-depth exploration and refinement of independent variables in the regression model.

- NA Values: There were some NA values. With more time, I will devote additional time to enhance data cleaning processes for increased model effectiveness.

- Categories: Some of the venues were grouped as others, with more time I will go on to group each venue adequately.
